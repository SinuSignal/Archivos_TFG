  abstract        = {A Local Area Network (LAN) is a computer network that connects computers with each other within a limited area such as a locality, college, office etc. Though Wi-Fi offers mobility, handiness and is cost effective than LAN connections in setting up, still LAN are being used at Library, Home, Offices for its fast transfer speed and higher reliability. Realizing the different threats associated with LAN based networks and hacking them to make them more secure by letting people know about this problem is what this paper is all about. In this paper, we have pointed out the common and existing attacks in LAN and also proposed a new attack of getting access of internet through different IP address and MAC address of same LAN by examining three Internet Service Providers in India. We have made this attack working by using some very useful but little known software's. This paper outlines the way one get access to others internet account and how to deal with it by making people familiar with scanning tool like Advanced IP Scanner and MAC Address Changer.},

  abstract        = {Authentication is a very important process for securing web applications. Username and password are two parameters commonly used for user authentication on the administrator's login page. However, such the two authentication parameters can be easily breached so that they can become a vulnerability that adversary parties can use to conduct malicious activities. For example, the attackers can commit a crime such as data modification or theft or even more dangerous take over administrator services of a system. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the security mechanism by adding additional factor of authentication other than username and password. In this study, an improvement in authentication mechanisms was carried out by applying MAC Address-based access control as an additional authentication factor. In this method, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used in mapping the users Internet Protocol (IP) address to their MAC address during validation process. The experimental results showed that the addition of the MAC address made the authentication process resistant to Dictionary Attack and Shoulder Surfing Attack.},

  abstract        = {NAT (Network Address Translation) is well-known as one of the short-term solutions of IPv4 address exhaustion. NAT is a technique that shares a single IP address in several PCs, and is widely used for alleviating the IPv4 address exhaustion and as a security solution. However, when a backbone network has access control function for PCs based on their IP addresses, it cannot identify the PCs under a NAT router since their original IP addresses are hidden by the NAT router. In this research, we focus on MAC address which identifies PC at datalink layer and propose a NAT router which relays the MAC addresses of PCs inside of a LAN to the outside. Since the source MAC addresses of packets sent from PCs are preserved even after being relayed by the NAT router, a LAN access control server outside of the NAT router can still identify these PCs based on their MAC addresses instead of their IP addresses.},

  abstract        = {In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic Mac address assignment and exchange strategy to reduce location disclosure risks. The use of dynamic Mac addresses in a local area network (LAN) is feasible since the address uniqueness needs only to be handled within the LAN. Though each node has a universal Mac address assigned by the manufacturer, a local unique Mac address is sufficient for the node to participate in communications. Our proposed strategy includes three major schemes. The first is to assign a Mac address to the client using the same idea as the IP address assignment. Next, a Mac addresses shuffle is conducted among the clients in the wide local area network (WLAN) without exposing any exchange relations or frequently disrupting current connections. Lastly, dummy messages are sent from the wireless client to cover others during idle. In current wireless networking, a client must communicate with an access point (AP) and authorization server in order to obtain authorization to access a local wireless network. In our scheme, we do not use a node's real physical Mac address when associating with an AP. Instead, there is a public special Mac address broadcast in the beacon messages which will be chosen as the source Mac address in the association request frame. As a result, the user will never expose its identifier when associated with the AP. The client also keeps a variant silent period as a defense against a correlation attack.},

  abstract        = {The primary function of the Internet protocol (IP) is delivering datagram's across an internetwork and addressing is one of the most important functions of IP. Communication between hosts over an internetwork is accomplished using IP addresses, but the actual communication over a physical network takes place using physical addresses. The mapping of IP addresses to physical addresses is done through address resolution methods. As address resolution is performed at each hop along the path through the Internet, efficiency of this process is of concern. In IP, address resolution queries and responses consume bandwidth, and end nodes are forced to waste CPU cycles receiving and discarding address resolution queries for other nodes which is an overhead. This paper explores the possibility of improving the performance of IPv6 packet transmission through the use of an efficient address resolution method. The performance of application processes depends on the throughput of the server and network. The throughput of a server depends on its processing power and load while the throughput of a network is directly influenced by the efficiency of routers, switches and bandwidth used. This paper proposes to use address resolution through direct mapping instead of dynamic binding which would enhance the efficiency of the address resolution process and plausibly improve the performance of IPv6 packet transmission.},
